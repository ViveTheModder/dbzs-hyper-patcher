# dbzs-hyper-patcher
A patcher for DBZ Sparking! HYPER that fixes a variety of issues: **crashes, typos, audio, visuals**. Comes with both a **command-line** and **GUI** version. 

Either way, it will only work as intended on an **untouched copy of DBZ Sparking! HYPER**, which can be found on [its website](https://dbzs-hyper.nekoweb.org/).

# How to Use
## Command-line
1. Navigate to the folder where the tool is downloaded, go to the address bar, type ``cmd`` and press Enter.
